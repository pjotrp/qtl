TODO list MQM package
- Make a V_0_C.exe which uses selected cofactors in stead of em all -DONE-

- Carl's book, make some plots about the listeria dataset -DONE-
- Use MQM with co-factors on Listeria set  -DONE-

- Use better thresholds for the listeria dataset (will require recompilation of MQM) -DONE-
- Remove input textfiles between C and R -DONE-
- -Not yet all input variables are send to C from R, we should choose defaults for all of em set them in R and send them to C -DONE-
- -Test the port of the analyse F2 in package -DONE-
- Push back the QTL-map to the Cross object (so we can use Carls visualizations) -DONE-

- Carl's book, make some plots about the listeria dataset using his plotting methode n correct scale -DONE-

- If there are Multiple traits in the cross object do them all when the user asks for it -DONE-
- - Store each run in a certain format (file) -DONE-
- - Store each bootstrapping runs in a certain format (file)
- Finish testing enviroment
- - A set of objects in csv format and in MQM input files
- - Double test augment data section -DONE-
- Extend the testsets (more with selected co-factors)
- Include correct RIL analysis, moved up after talk 11-febr-2009
- Include correct BC analysis, moved up after talk 11-febr-2009
- - both could perhaps be done with getting the recombinant frequencies from R and then adjusting the algorithm
- - this would remove rmixture function (which is outdated by the R/QTL est.map & calc.genoprob functions as far as i can tell)
- - this would involve a mayor rewriting some of the QTLmixture part (perhaps even regression, but that relies on 
- - the weightmatrix (setting them 0 could be an option))
- Remove bootstrapping from scanMQM and make it done by R -DONE-

MID TERM
Use stl (+boost) for all internal vectors and matrices -MOVED TO FORK-
We need a working dataset of carl with 2 qtls to show we have increased power in MQM
Figure out a correct way of handling autosomes

LONG TERM
Include 4-way cross analysis
Write report about masterinternship II at GBIC
