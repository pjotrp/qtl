TODO list MQM package
- Make a V_0_C.exe which uses selected cofactors in stead of em all -DONE-

- Carl's book, make some plots about the listeria dataset -DONE-
- Use MQM with co-factors on Listeria set  -DONE-

- Use better thresholds for the listeria dataset (will require recompilation of MQM) -DONE-
- Remove input textfiles between C and R -DONE-
- -Not yet all input variables are send to C from R, we should choose defaults for all of em set them in R and send them to C -DONE-
- -Test the port of the analyse F2 in package -DONE-
- Push back the QTL-map to the Cross object (so we can use Carls visualizations) -DONE-

- Carl's book, make some plots about the listeria dataset using his plotting methode n correct scale
- Finish testing enviroment
- - Same goes here, show that using cofactors we can increase detection power of other QTLs
- - We need a working dataset of carl with 2 qtls to show we have increased power in MQM
- Extend the testsets (more with selected co-factors)
- -perhaps: try a family run (F1 and F2 marker data)
